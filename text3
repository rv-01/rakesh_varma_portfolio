ðŸš€ Desired Outcome After 6 Months
Objective:
Establish a production-ready Metadata Automation Framework that is scalable, extensible, and integrated into Citiâ€™s metadata management and governance ecosystem.

âœ… What Should Be Achieved After 6 Months:
Full Plugin Coverage:

Metadata extraction operational for at least 6â€“8 major sources, including Python, Java, APIs, databases, CSVs, and documentation.

Modular plugin framework allowing new extractors to be added easily for future sources (e.g., cloud data lakes, pipelines).

Enterprise-Grade Pipeline:

CI/CD-enabled automated metadata ingestion pipeline.

Metadata refresh on scheduled intervals (e.g., daily) and on-demand events (e.g., code commits, data uploads).

Production-Ready Knowledge Graph:

Fully scalable Neo4j / MongoDB knowledge graph hosting millions of metadata nodes and relationships.

Complex graph traversal supported (e.g., impact analysis, lineage tracing, dependency chains across systems).

Robust REST API and Integrations:

Well-documented REST API serving metadata to tools like Collibra, Solidatus, and internal Citi platforms.

Bulk export features (CSV, JSON) available for ad-hoc governance reporting.

Monitoring and Observability:

Real-time metrics dashboard tracking:

Metadata volume growth

Source system coverage

API usage and query patterns

Extraction success/failure rates

Governance Alignment:

Metadata enriched with business context, data classifications (e.g., PII, regulatory reporting), and linked to governance frameworks.

Alignment with Citiâ€™s enterprise metadata standards and governance requirements.

User Adoption and Business Impact:

Active usage by key stakeholder teams (e.g., Data Governance, Risk, Markets Technology).

Significant reduction (~50% or more) in manual metadata collection and documentation effort.
