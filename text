üöÄ Initial Thoughts: 2-Week Proof of Concept (PoC) Plan
In 2 weeks, the goal would be to demonstrate the core capabilities of the Metadata Automation Framework at a working prototype level ‚Äî covering extraction, basic validation, storage into a graph catalog (Neo4j or MongoDB), and simple API access.

Here‚Äôs what could realistically be achieved in 2 weeks:

‚úÖ What Can Be Achieved
1. Core Metadata Extraction Plugins (Minimum 3)
Build functional prototypes for:

Source Code Extractor (Python scripts only, using ast).

Documentation Extractor (basic PDF extraction using PyPDF2).

Database Extractor (connect to a sample PostgreSQL DB using SQLAlchemy and extract table/column metadata).

Keep Plugin architecture modular so that new sources (like Java or APIs) can be added later easily.

2. Simple Automated Metadata Pipeline
Create a basic orchestration script (Python + schedule or simple cron job simulation).

Enable hourly trigger or manual trigger for metadata extraction.

Validate that extracted metadata has basic fields (name, type, source).

3. Knowledge Graph-Based Catalog
Stand up Neo4j Community Edition (or MongoDB Atlas free tier).

Load extracted metadata as:

Nodes (e.g., functions, tables, documents).

Relationships (e.g., function uses column, document references API).

Implement basic graph queries (like: "find all functions that use customer_id").

4. Lightweight Integration API
Develop a Flask-based REST API with minimal endpoints:

/metadata/{name} ‚Äî fetch metadata by name.

/metadata/search?type=function ‚Äî search metadata by type.

Basic JSON response formatting.

5. Metrics Dashboard (Very Basic)
Track and log simple metrics:

Number of metadata records extracted.

Time taken for each extraction phase.

Store metrics in a log file or lightweight SQLite DB for now.

üß© Stretch Goals (Optional If Time Permits)
Add API Extractor prototype (for 1-2 sample APIs using requests).

Basic enrichment (e.g., tagging ‚Äúregulatory reporting‚Äù manually for few entries).

A basic UI mockup (even simple Swagger UI or Postman collection) for demoing REST API queries.

üî• Deliverables at End of 2 Weeks
Working Python-based metadata extractors (3 types).

Populated Knowledge Graph DB (sample metadata).

REST API serving extracted metadata.

Demo script showcasing a sample end-to-end flow (commit Python file ‚ûî trigger extraction ‚ûî validate ‚ûî store in graph ‚ûî retrieve via API).

Initial metrics report.

Documentation: architecture diagram + next steps for full build-out.

üß† Risks and Assumptions
Focus only on Python source code for code extraction (no Java parsing in Phase 1).

No enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline yet ‚Äî run scheduled tasks locally.

Use small controlled datasets (small sample PDFs, code, databases) for PoC.

Skip authentication/security for API in the PoC.

‚ú® In One Line:
In 2 weeks, we can build a minimal, working prototype demonstrating metadata extraction, validation, graph cataloging, and REST API access, laying the foundation for scaling across Citi‚Äôs enterprise systems.
