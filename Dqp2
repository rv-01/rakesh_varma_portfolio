Here are functional and non-functional requirements for your Adaptive Data Quality Platform (Python-based, ML-driven, Flask UI, Database-backed)—structured for clarity and presentation:

⸻

Functional Requirements

These describe what the system should do:

1. Data Ingestion & Integration
	•	Load datasets from files (CSV, Parquet) and connect to relational databases (e.g., SQLite, Oracle).
	•	Support schema introspection and metadata extraction during ingestion.
	•	Allow scheduled or trigger-based ingestion jobs.

2. Data Profiling Module
	•	Automatically analyze ingested data to compute statistics (e.g., null counts, cardinality, distributions).
	•	Detect outliers, drifts, and anomalies using ML models like Isolation Forest.
	•	Identify data patterns and suggest potential data quality issues.

3. Adaptive Rule Engine
	•	Generate adaptive data quality rules based on profiling insights.
	•	Allow rule simulation, validation, and approval by users (Human-in-the-Loop).
	•	Automatically apply learned rules to new incoming data.

4. Explainability Layer
	•	For each rule trigger, present which model or heuristic flagged it.
	•	Show key metrics: deviation score, impacted columns, frequency.
	•	Support drill-down into specific flagged records with visual summaries.

5. UI/UX (via Flask)
	•	Dashboard with:
	•	Data quality trends
	•	Flagged anomalies by date/source/table
	•	Static vs adaptive rule performance
	•	Rule Management UI: view, approve, edit, override adaptive rules
	•	Data Explorer: preview ingested data and profiling summary
	•	Review Panel: display flagged records with feedback options

6. Audit & Governance
	•	Store and version each rule, its justification, and who approved it.
	•	Maintain audit logs of each rule execution and user decision.
	•	Export rule history and audit data for compliance purposes.

7. Monitoring & Notifications
	•	Real-time or scheduled scans for detecting data issues.
	•	Trigger email or UI alerts for severe anomalies or SLA violations.

Non-Functional Requirements

These describe how the system should perform:

1. Scalability
	•	Handle datasets with millions of records.
	•	Modular design to support integration of new ML models or data sources.

2. Performance
	•	Data profiling and anomaly detection must run under acceptable latency (e.g., under 1 min for 100K rows).
	•	UI response time should be < 2 seconds for interactive actions.

3. Reliability & Availability
	•	Application should be fault-tolerant (retry on failure for ingestion or model errors).
	•	Uptime target: 99.5% or better.

4. Usability
	•	Web UI should be intuitive for data analysts and non-technical users.
	•	Rules should be human-readable and explainable.

5. Security
	•	Role-based access to data, rules, and audit logs.
	•	Secure storage of sensitive data (via encryption if needed).
	•	Authentication for admin and analyst roles (can use basic login for POC).

6. Maintainability
	•	Clean modular Python codebase with documentation and unit tests.
	•	Clear separation of concerns: ingestion, profiling, rule generation, UI, storage.

7. Portability
	•	Should run on local development environments (e.g., Docker or venv).
	•	Cloud-ready architecture for future deployment (e.g., Flask app can be containerized).

8. Extensibility
	•	Easy to plug in new ML models for profiling.
	•	Add new rule types or anomaly detectors with minimal changes.

Here is the sequence and data flow diagram for the Adaptive Data Quality Platform:

Flow Description:
	1.	User (Data Analyst) interacts via Flask UI.
	2.	UI triggers the Data Ingestion module to load data from files or databases.
	3.	Data is passed to the Data Profiler, which computes statistics and data distributions.
	4.	The profiler output is fed to the ML Model (Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection.
	5.	Detected anomalies are interpreted by the Rule Generator, which suggests adaptive data quality rules.
	6.	These rules are fed into:
	•	The Explainability Layer, which provides transparency into why rules were suggested.
	•	The Audit Log, where all rule generations, triggers, and user feedback are stored.
	7.	Finally, both audit and explainability outputs power the Monitoring Dashboard, showing trends and flagged data.


To achieve a dynamic profiler with minimal manual intervention, you can focus on a few core strategies:
	1.	Automated Data Profiling: Implement a module that periodically scans incoming data and profiles it using your chosen ML models. This can be triggered by data ingestion events or run on a schedule.
	2.	Adaptive Rule Generation: Use the insights from the profiling module to generate and refine rules automatically. For example, if the model detects a new type of anomaly or pattern, it can suggest new rules or adjust existing thresholds.
	3.	Feedback Loop: Incorporate a feedback mechanism where the system learns from user interactions or corrections. This helps the platform evolve and improve its accuracy over time.
	4.	Monitoring and Alerts: Set up real-time monitoring and alerts for significant deviations or anomalies. This way, the system can flag issues promptly without constant manual oversight.
	5.	Explainability and Governance: Ensure each generated rule comes with explanations and evidence, so users can understand and trust the system’s decisions.


1.	Isolation Forest:
	•	Advantages: It’s an unsupervised model that excels at identifying outliers in high-dimensional data. It works well even with small sample sizes and doesn’t require labeled data.
	•	Prerequisites: You just need to ensure the data is properly normalized or scaled for best performance.
	2.	DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):
	•	Advantages: This clustering algorithm is great for identifying clusters of varying density and can easily spot anomalies that don’t fit into any cluster.
	•	Prerequisites: It works best when you have a clear idea of the data distribution and can fine-tune parameters like epsilon and minimum samples.
	3.	Autoencoders:
	•	Advantages: These are neural networks used for high-dimensional data and can learn to reconstruct normal data patterns. Anomalies are detected based on reconstruction error.
	•	Prerequisites: Requires a larger dataset and more computational resources but can be very effective for complex data.
	4.	One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine):
	•	Advantages: Useful for novelty detection when you have a lot of normal data and want to spot deviations.
	•	Prerequisites: It works well when you have a good sample of “normal” data to train on.

Each of these models has its strengths, so you might want to experiment with a couple of them to see which one fits your data and use case best. Also, make sure your data is cleaned and normalized before feeding it into these models. Let me know if you want more details on any specific model!


Starting with a proof of concept is a smart move! For the POC, you can focus on a few key elements to demonstrate the platform’s potential:
	1.	Data Profiling: Implement a basic data profiling module that can analyze a sample dataset to detect common anomalies like missing values, outliers, and distribution shifts.
	2.	ML Model for Anomaly Detection: Use a simple ML model, like an isolation forest or clustering algorithm, to detect unusual patterns in the data.
	3.	Rule Generation: Based on the anomalies detected, generate a few sample data quality rules automatically.
	4.	Simple UI: Create a minimal web interface (using Flask) that shows the profiling results, detected anomalies, and suggested rules.


The key components you might consider are:
	1.	Data Profiling Module: This will continuously analyze the data to detect patterns and outliers.
	2.	ML-Driven Rule Generator: This component will use the insights from profiling to suggest new data quality rules and thresholds.
	3.	Explainability Layer: This ensures that each generated rule is transparent and understandable, showing why a rule was suggested.
	4.	Human-in-the-Loop Interface: Allow users to review and approve these rules, ensuring a balance between automation and expert oversight.
	5.	Monitoring Dashboard: Visualize data quality trends, rule effectiveness, and any detected anomalies over time.
