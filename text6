ðŸŽ¯ Slide Title:
MetaXtract: Automating Oracle SQL Metadata Extraction

ðŸ”„ Comparison Table

Aspect	Manual Approach (Before)	Proposed Approach (MetaXtract)
Metadata Extraction	Manual parsing of SQL files	Automatic extraction from CREATE TABLE and CREATE VIEW
Duplicate Detection	Done manually or often missed	Automated duplicate detection based on DB, Schema, Table, Column
Error Reporting	Not systematic; issues found late in testing	Errors logged and exported to JSON/CSV instantly
Output Format	Manual notes, Excel sheets	Structured JSON & CSV output with configurable field order
View Handling	Complex to trace view-column mapping manually	Resolves view columns to source tables with type & length
Scalability	Painful with large number of files	Handles folders and subfolders recursively
Customizability	Rigid process, hard to adapt	Config-driven (field order, easy future enhancements)
Speed & Accuracy	Slow, error-prone	Fast, accurate, and consistent every run
âœ… Benefits of MetaXtract
80%+ time savings by automating metadata extraction and validation

Improved accuracy by reducing manual copy-paste and interpretation errors

Standardized output for easy consumption by downstream tools (catalogs, Excel, audits)

Audit-ready: Errors and issues logged in a transparent, structured format

Pluggable and extensible architecture for future enhancements (e.g., PK detection, SQL parsing libraries)

Developer & Architect friendly â€” fits directly into your Git/CI/CD workflows

ðŸ’¡ Conclusion
MetaXtract replaces error-prone, time-consuming manual SQL reviews
with an automated, scalable, and configurable solution for metadata extraction.

Slide Design Tip:
To visualize this:

Use a side-by-side comparison table in the middle (Manual vs MetaXtract)

Add a Benefits bullet box below

Add your tool logo and tagline at the top (e.g., "MetaXtract: Automate. Validate. Accelerate.")

Would you like me to also generate this as a PowerPoint slide or PDF one-pager design?
I can do that visually too â€” just say "generate slide" and Iâ€™ll share it!
