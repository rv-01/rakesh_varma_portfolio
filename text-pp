Deployment Models & Architecture	18. What deployment models are available: SaaS only, private cloud, hybrid, on-premises?
19. How are upgrades and patches handled without disrupting critical pipelines?
Cost and License Model	20. (Important to ask gently) â€” How is the licensing structured: per user, per data volume, per project?
21. Are there additional charges for data connectors, APIs, storage, or scaling?
Migration and Lock-in Risk	22. How easy is it to export data, metadata, and logic if we ever decide to move out of Palantir?
23. How open is Foundry in terms of interoperability with non-Palantir tools?
ðŸ§  Bonus "Strategic" Questions (to show you're thinking long-term)
How does Palantir Foundry align with the principles of Data Mesh (domain ownership, self-serve data infrastructure)?

What are the best practices for building governance around a federated customer master without centralizing all data?

Can Foundry support multi-cloud architectures (AWS + Azure + GCP) if we expand?

How can Foundry support AI/ML governance and model lineage if we embed ML models into customer decisioning?

ðŸ§© Tips During the Presentation
Listen carefully for "black box" answers â€” push politely if they don't explain how something actually works.

Focus on operationalization and real-world fit â€” not just demos.

Ask them for specific examples (especially if they talk about "global banks" or "large insurance companies" using GFCM with Palantir).

ðŸš€ Final Pro Tip
At the end, you can ask:

"If we choose Palantir, what is the typical technical onboarding timeline for a first major use case (e.g., GFCM)?"
(to gauge how fast or complex it is in reality.)


ðŸ§  1. "How does Palantir Foundry manage semantic versioning of data models across federated systems, especially when source schemas evolve asynchronously?"
âœ… Why this is impressive:

You're thinking about real-world schema drift (source tables changing over time).

Youâ€™re signaling you want zero downtime, backward compatibility, and long-term resilience.

Most architects miss asking about semantic versioning â€” itâ€™s critical when you're federating live systems across countries or business units.

If they handle it well, they should mention things like:

Ontology versioning,

Schema evolution support,

Backward-compatible transforms,

Layered modeling with "frozen snapshots" and "live layers."

ðŸ§  2. "What patterns does Palantir recommend to implement federated computational governance (e.g., decentralized quality checks, domain-specific rules enforcement) without creating centralized bottlenecks?"
âœ… Why this is impressive:

You're showing you understand data mesh and decentralized governance ideas.

Youâ€™re thinking beyond data storage â€” about distributed responsibility, scaling, and organizational design.

You want to know how they let different teams build on the platform safely and independently.

If they handle it well, they might mention:

Local validation layers,

Automated data quality checks (at source),

Policy-as-code enforcement,

Domain-specific transformations (before onboarding into the global ontology),

Self-service onboarding kits for data producers.

ðŸ“¢ Bonus "Polite Trap" Question (if you want to test depth)
You can ask at the end:

"How would you recommend designing a fallback strategy if entity resolution confidence drops below a threshold at runtime?"

This tests:

Whether they think in probabilistic terms,

Whether they have graceful degradation patterns,

Whether they expose entity confidence scores,

Whether they allow human-in-the-loop or semi-automated corrections.

(Only ask this if they present a lot about entity resolution!)

ðŸŽ¯ In short:
If you ask even one of these tomorrow, youâ€™ll immediately differentiate yourself as a technical architect who is thinking operationally, at scale, and in future-proof architecture terms.
