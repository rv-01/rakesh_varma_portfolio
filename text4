ðŸš€ Additional Resources Required (Realistic if Mostly Done by Me)
1. People Resources:

Primary Developer:

Myself (leading design, development, and integration).

Light Support (Ad-hoc, if needed):

DevOps/Cloud Engineer (Advisory, 10â€“20% time):
Help with initial setup of hosting (Neo4j Aura / MongoDB Atlas) and basic deployment pipelines.

Data Governance SME (Consultation, a few hours total):
Review business context enrichment rules and align metadata fields to standards.

2. Infrastructure Resources:

Graph Database Service:

Provision a Neo4j Aura (Starter tier) or MongoDB Atlas cluster (Shared tier) for metadata storage.

Python Hosting Environment:

Lightweight server or internal VM (even a single small AWS EC2 instance or Citi VM) to run extractors and REST API.

DevOps Tools:

Access to basic GitHub Actions or Citiâ€™s internal CI/CD tooling to automate pipeline execution.

3. Access and Permissions:

Sample Systems Access:

Access to a few Python codebases, sample PDFs, test APIs, and sample database schemas for building and testing extractors.

API Keys and Credentials:

Service accounts or dummy credentials for development environments.

âœ¨ In One Line:
Since I will be leading and executing most of the work, I require only minimal DevOps support, lightweight infrastructure (managed DB + small VM), and access to sample systems for extractor development and validation.
