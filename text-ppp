ðŸ§  1. How does Palantir manage schema evolution across federated systems without requiring heavy rework in downstream models?
Why important:
Real-world source systems change all the time.
As an architect, I need to know if the platform can handle schema drift gracefully â€” otherwise, weâ€™ll spend months constantly fixing broken pipelines.

ðŸ§  2. Can you explain how entity resolution works technically, and how confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop correction are handled at scale?
Why important:
Entity resolution is the heart of a Global Customer Master.
I want to know if itâ€™s accurate, explainable, adjustable, and whether operations teams can correct mistakes without opening massive tickets.

ðŸ§  3. How is fine-grained governance implemented â€” specifically, can you enforce row-level, column-level, and attribute-level security policies across federated data?
Why important:
Because governance is critical â€” especially for customer data (GDPR, CCPA, banking regulations).
I need to know if they have granular control, not just "big-bucket" access rights.

ðŸ§  4. What is your recommended architecture for supporting real-time API access to the unified customer profiles, and how do you ensure freshness, consistency, and low latency?
Why important:
This tests if the GFCM is only batch-oriented (good for reports) or truly operational (good for live apps like onboarding, fraud detection, marketing personalization).
Low latency and data freshness are essential for real-world impact.

ðŸ§  5. If we invest into Palantir deeply, how easy or hard would it be to migrate our data models, pipelines, and ontologies if we ever want to move off the platform?
Why important:
Vendor lock-in risk is real.
Even if Palantir is amazing, good architects always plan an exit strategy.
If they say "no way" or "very hard", you know you need to think carefully about dependency.
